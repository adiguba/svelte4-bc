# Svelte 4 Backward Compatibility for Svelte 5

**svelte4-bc** is a plugin that improves Svelte 4 backwards compatibility in Svelte 5

## Why ?

**Svelte 5** is already backwards compatible with the **Svelte 4** syntax (slots, on:events directives).

But when a component is migrated to the new syntax (snippet/handlers), all the calling codes that use this component should also be migrated in order to replace slots/on:events by snippets/handlers.
This can be problematic on large projects.

**svelte4-bc** allows to use snippets/handlers within a component, while accepting slots/on:events from the outside.
